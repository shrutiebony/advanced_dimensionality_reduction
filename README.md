# advanced_dimensionality_reduction

### 1. Repository Structure
We need to create a clear structure for your project. The directory will include:

Image Data Notebook: Dimensionality reduction on datasets like Olivetti Faces or MNIST.
Tabular Data Notebook: Techniques applied to datasets like Iris or medical datasets.
Databricks Implementation Notebook: Dimensionality reduction workflows implemented in Databricks.
ReadMe File: Detailed documentation with commentary on methods, results, comparisons, and visualizations.
Datasets: All required datasets (publicly available, e.g., UCI, Kaggle, or Scikit-learn datasets).
### 2. Key Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
We will implement the following methods:

#### Linear Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Randomized PCA
Incremental PCA
Factor Analysis
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)
#### Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction
Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
Standard LLE
Modified LLE
t-SNE (Interactive Visualization)
ISOMAP
UMAP (Interactive Visualization)
Kernel PCA (Non-linear extension of PCA)
Autoencoders
### 3. Implementation Plan
#### A. Image Data Notebook
Use Olivetti Faces dataset from Scikit-learn or MNIST from Keras.
Apply all techniques above to analyze the dataset.
Visualize results using tools like Matplotlib and Plotly for interactive 2D/3D plots.
Generate insights:
Which technique clusters similar faces better?
Which one preserves global vs. local structures?
#### B. Tabular Data Notebook
Use Iris Dataset or Medical Data (e.g., diabetes dataset from Scikit-learn).
Implement the same dimensionality reduction techniques.
Create plots for 2D/3D data representations.
Insights:
How well do these techniques uncover separable clusters or patterns in medical data?
#### C. Databricks Notebook
Use Databricks to process a larger dataset (e.g., Kaggle medical datasets or high-dimensional tabular data).
Compare processing speed, efficiency, and memory consumption between Databricks and Colab.
### 4. Visualization Tools
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For simple plots.
Plotly: Interactive visualizations.
PairCode UMAP Tool: For UMAP interactive visualization.
Bokeh or Altair: For advanced interactivity.
